 I’m a software tester with a passion for open source projects and a keen interest in software developing and testing.

👀 With an eye for detail and quality, I immerse myself in the dynamic world of software testing, full-stack development, and the fascinating realm of machine learning.

🌱 Currently, I'm on a journey mastering C# and honing my expertise in JUnit and Selenium WebDriver to engineer robust test cases.

💞️ I'm on the lookout for collaborative opportunities in open source projects that champion educational resources and foster community engagement.
