👋 Hi, I’m @Konstantin Petkov. I’m a software tester with a passion for open source projects and a keen interest in software developing and testing.

👀 I’m interested in software testing, full-stack development and machine learning.

🌱 I’m currently learning C# and improving my skills in JUnit and Selenium WebDriver to create successful test cases.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that focus on educational tools and community-driven content.
